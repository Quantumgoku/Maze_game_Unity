# Unity Maze Game

A simple maze game developed using Unity. The player is spawned at a random location in a 4x4 maze and needs to find the way to one of the four corners, which is randomly chosen as the endpoint. The game includes a timer to record the completion time and a high score feature to track the best time.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Player spawns at a random position and can move to navigate the maze.
- **Timer**: Tracks the time taken to complete the maze.
- **High Score**: Records the shortest time to complete the maze and displays it in the pause menu.
- **Pause Menu**: Allows players to pause the game, view the high score, and return to the main menu.
